# Sentinel Control

Local-first workspace for the Sentinel Control product family.

This repo is organized around three active areas:

- `apps/web/` - the Next.js UI for Sentinel Control
- `services/sentinel-core/` - the Python agent core, firewall, debate, and execution logic
- `packages/evals/` - JSONL datasets for Sentinel safety and quality evaluations
- `supabase/migrations/` - database schema for runs, evidence, actions, traces, and policies

Supporting material:

- `docs/` - product, security, and implementation docs
- `docs/brain/` - certified brain boundary and review matrix
- `preview/` - static preview fallback for browser checks

Related local workspace:

- `../agent-lab/` - research-only lab for studying external agent runtimes without integrating them into Sentinel production

Sprint 8 adds the GTM Pack Quality layer. The dashboard can import CueIdea validations, generate local GTM files, and score each pack against business-quality gates before it is considered ready.

Use `apps/web/.env.example` as the hosted/dev environment template. Real local credentials live in `apps/web/.env.local`, which is ignored by git.

## Working Rule

Edit source, not generated output. The generated directories are ignored and can be recreated when needed.

High-impact capabilities remain authority-classed: email sending, shell execution, code modification, unrestricted filesystem access, and payments remain non-delegated. Browser form submit, download quarantine, upload authorized, private session, login authority, cookie/storage contracts, sandboxed JS evaluate, and HAR/body capture exist only through explicit Browser V3 contracts, receipts, and FinalGate checks.
