# Current State Lock

Date: 2026-05-07

## Phase

```text
current_phase = P5D5_FULL_LOCKED
previous_phase = P5D_FULL_LOCKED
next_phase = P5E_MISSION_GLOBAL_WORKSPACE
```

P5D.5 is accepted as full locked. It is a doctrine-only capital operator tranche
that distinguishes fixed root authority from adaptive operating allocation. It
does not implement runtime payment, trading, account creation, browser powers,
external API powers, credential access, agent spawning, or authority expansion.

## Verification

```text
P5D.5 docs verification = diff check passed
targeted P5D tests = 11 passed
targeted P5B/P5C tests = 12 passed
full sentinel-core regression = not rerun for P5D.5
```

Commands verified:

```bash
git diff --check -- sentinel-control/docs/CURRENT_STATE_LOCK.md sentinel-control/docs/brain
python -m pytest tests/test_agent_society_manager.py -v --tb=short
python -m pytest tests/test_agent_mission_entropy.py tests/test_agent_count_controller.py -v --tb=short
```

Full sentinel-core was intentionally not rerun for this P5D.5 pass because the
tranche is docs-only and the user requested small targeted verification.

## P5D.5 Required Files

These files are required to preserve the P5D.5 full lock:

```text
sentinel-control/docs/brain/P5D5_CAPITAL_OPERATOR_DOCTRINE.md
sentinel-control/docs/brain/P5D5_ADAPTIVE_OPERATING_ENVELOPE.md

## P5D.5 Locked Doctrine

P5D.5 locks:

```text
RootAuthorityEnvelope = fixed user mandate boundaries
AdaptiveOperatingEnvelope = dynamic operating parameters inside root boundaries
SignalLedger = evidence for operating changes
BudgetReallocator = moves spend toward stronger signals without crossing authority
DynamicSpendPolicy = spend/hold/scale/cut/propose-extension doctrine
SpendDecisionTrace = reason, signal, risk, budget, receipt, and stop-condition proof
```

Core rule:

```text
Authority boundaries do not silently expand.
Operational allocation must adapt continuously inside those boundaries.
```

Current core still treats payment/spend/credential actions as blocked black-zone
actions. P5D.5 does not change runtime behavior.

If explicit spend authority is granted in a future runtime, Sentinel should be
able to act inside that authority rather than remain passive. Any action outside
root authority requires an `AuthorityExtensionProposal`.

## P5D Required Files

These files are required to preserve the P5D full lock:

```text
sentinel-control/services/sentinel-core/sentinel/agent/agent_society.py
sentinel-control/services/sentinel-core/sentinel/agent/events.py

## P5D Locked Doctrine

`AgentSocietyManager` is advisory only.

It consumes:

```text
AgentCountRoute
MissionEntropyEstimate
MissionAuthorityEnvelope
```

It produces deterministic outputs:

```text
AgentSocietyPlan
AgentRoleAssignment
AgentOutputContract
AgentRolePurpose
AgentSocietyPlanStatus
```

It may emit:

```text
AGENT_SOCIETY_PLANNED
AGENT_ROLE_ASSIGNED
```

Each role must map to at least one P5C.5 first-principles purpose:

```text
exploration
verification
aggregation
contradiction
cost control
context compression
authority-bound fallback
```

It must not grant:

```text
tools
actions
paths
browser powers
external systems
credentials
payments
channel sending
desktop control
```

It must not spawn agents and must not implement runtime multi-agent execution.

## P5C.5 Required Files

These files remain required to preserve the P5C.5 full lock:

```

## P5C Required Files

These files remain required to preserve the P5C full lock:

```text
sentinel-control/services/sentinel-core/sentinel/agent/agent_count.py
sentinel-control/services/sentinel-core/tests/test_agent_count_controller.py
sentinel-control/docs/brain/P5C_AGENT_COUNT_SCORECARD.md
sentinel-control/docs/brain/P5C_LOCK_VERDICT.md
```

## P5B Required Files

These files remain required to preserve the P5B full lock:

```text
sentinel-control/services/sentinel-core/sentinel/agent/mission_entropy.py
sentinel-control/services/sentinel-core/tests/test_agent_mission_entropy.py
sentinel-control/docs/brain/P5B_MISSION_ENTROPY_SCORECARD.md
sentinel-control/docs/brain/P5B_LOCK_VERDICT.md
```

## Boundary

Do not start P5E in this pass.

Do not start the next organ.

Do not add new browser powers.

Do not implement runtime multi-agent execution.

Do not silently expand authority.
