# Agent Lab Plan

## Mission

Build a controlled research lab for agent runtimes. The lab studies capabilities, failure modes, and reusable architecture patterns without integrating risky execution into Sentinel Control.

## Current Decision

Keep this workspace separate from `sentinel-control`.

Sentinel remains focused on:

1. GTM Pack quality.
2. Evidence-backed business decisions.
3. AgentOps Firewall controls.
4. Safe local execution only.

Agent Lab focuses on:

1. Runtime research.
2. Capability benchmarking.
3. Failure-mode mapping.
4. Future runtime blueprinting.

Current strategic correction:

- Agent Lab is now upgraded into Agent Forensics Lab.
- Vendors are specimens, not integrations.
- The output is Sentinel rewrite knowledge: `Superpower`, `Failure`, `Sentinel Rewrite`.
- No OpenClaw/Hermes/OpenJarvis/JARVIS bridge is authorized.
- No vendor code is copied into Sentinel.
- No vendor runtime is installed or run.

## Sprint A - Lab Setup

Status: in progress.

Tasks:

- Create isolated workspace structure.

Acceptance:

- No vendor code is copied into Sentinel.
- Every benchmark uses sandbox resources.
- Every risky feature has a proposed Sentinel Firewall mitigation.

## Sprint B - Capability Matrix

Status: started with OpenClaw Sprint B1 static audit.

Tasks:

- Fill in observations for OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, OpenJarvis, and JARVIS.
- Map each capability to Sentinel current and Sentinel target.

- Every risky power has Firewall, trace, and eval implications.

## Sprint G1 - Hermes Forensic Audit

Status: initial source-only forensic audit completed.

Focus:

- memory persistence;
- skill prompt index;
- tool hooks;
- prompt injection scanning;
- delegation/subagent iteration budgets;
- skill creation and Google Workspace setup risks.

## Sprint G2 - OpenJarvis Forensic Audit

Status: initial source-only forensic audit completed.

Focus:

- local/cloud routing;
- hardware-aware model choice;
- learning metrics;
- agent config evolution;
- skill import/sync from external sources.

## Sprint G3 - JARVIS Forensic Audit

Status: initial source-only forensic audit completed.

Focus:

- daemon and sidecar;

## Sprint G4 - Sentinel Super Agent Synthesis

Status: initial synthesis completed, now paused before build planning.

Completed:

- created `audits/SENTINEL_SUPER_AGENT_BLUEPRINT.md`;
- created `audits/SENTINEL_RUNTIME_CAPABILITY_ROADMAP.md`;
- created `audits/SENTINEL_AGENT_LOOP_SPEC.md`;
- created `audits/SENTINEL_MEMORY_SPEC.md`;
- created `audits/SENTINEL_SKILL_SPEC.md`;
- created `audits/SENTINEL_COST_ROUTER_SPEC.md`;
- created `audits/SENTINEL_SIDECAR_SPEC.md`.

Synthesis rule:

- OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, OpenJarvis, and JARVIS remain lab specimens.
- Sentinel must rewrite capabilities from first principles.
- No vendor runtime, vendor bridge, vendor dependency, or vendor code path is approved for Sentinel.
- This synthesis is not sufficient to build the final Sentinel runtime.
- The next phase is one final lab-grade forensic report per vendor before any global build plan.

Core Sentinel loop:

```text
see -> verify -> reason -> debate -> plan -> simulate -> approve -> execute -> trace -> learn
```

Capability gates:

- memory can inform decisions but cannot override policy;
- skills must be scanned, declared, sandboxed, permissioned, tested, approved, and traced;
- cost routing must enforce budget caps and trace model/provider choices;
- sidecar/browser/channel powers remain later-stage capabilities behind manifests, dry-run previews, approval, and fake benchmarks.

## Agent-by-Agent Deep Reverse Phase

Status: active.

Rule:

- No Sentinel runtime build is authorized from G0-G4 alone.
- Each vendor must receive a final forensic report before final cross-agent synthesis.
- Reports must cite local source paths, functions/classes/modules, algorithms, prompts, side effects, failures, and Sentinel rewrite principles.
- Vendor sources remain specimens only: no install, no runtime, no integration, no copied code.

Order:

1. OpenClaw final forensic report.
2. Hermes final forensic report.
3. OpenJarvis final forensic report.
4. JARVIS final forensic report.
5. Final cross-agent comparison.
6. Sentinel architecture from first principles.

- specified the core loop: see, verify, research, debate, decide, plan, simulate, approve, execute_safe, trace, learn;
- defined module contracts for Perception Gateway, Evidence Ledger, Research Enrichment, Debate Engine, Action Kernel, Firewall, Safe Executors, Learning Layer, Memory, Skill Scanner, CostRouter, Browser, Channels, Sidecar, and Eval Roadmap;
- defined core data contracts for EvidenceItem, DecisionPlan, AgentAction, DryRun, TraceRecord, Memory, Skill Manifest, Cost Route, Sidecar Manifest, Browser Extraction, and Channel Draft;
- locked runtime capability order: product core first, control core second, AgentOps moat third, runtime power later;
- kept future browser, channel, workflow, sidecar, and desktop capabilities disabled until fake benchmarks and policy gates exist;
- documented eval gates for evidence quality, GTM readiness, firewall blocking, memory poisoning, skill scanning, budget control, trace completeness, fake browser, fake channel, fake workflow, and fake sidecar behavior.

Status: completed debate/specification correction.

Output:

- `audits/final/g11_debate_verdict_aggressive_control.md`
- `audits/SENTINEL_POWER_MODE_SPEC.md`

Completed:

- analyzed `debat.md` as a product-strategy debate source;
- accepted the correction that Sentinel must be aggressive in safe, reversible, local, and draft-only zones;
- rejected a global Full Access button as too broad and weakly auditable;
- defined Power Mode as future scoped authority through explicit authority envelopes;
- reframed the Firewall as a tempo router: green executes, amber previews, red requires approval or scoped authority, black remains unavailable until capability-specific evals pass;
- preserved the G10 boundary that no shell, browser submit, real channel send, sidecar runtime, desktop automation, runtime install, production self-mutation, or vendor bridge is enabled now;
- set the next implementation direction as Core Kernel with green-zone auto-execution rather than fear-based blocking.

Acceptance:

- Power Mode exists as a future architecture spec only.
- No risky runtime power is enabled.

  - `deep-research-report (1).md`;
  - `deep-research-report (1)cc.md`;
  - `Designing Autonomous Agent Mission Authority.md`;
- accepted the research conclusion that Sentinel should not be permission-per-action by default;
- promoted `MissionAuthorityEnvelope` above Power Mode as the primary agentic primitive;
- defined the core doctrine: permission once for the mission, autonomy inside the mission, escalation only at the boundary;
- preserved G10/G11 boundaries: no shell, real browser submit, real email/channel send, desktop control, sidecar runtime, payment, dependency install, credential access, production mutation, or vendor runtime integration;
- specified MissionAuthorityEnvelope, MissionState, MissionAction, EscalationRequest, MissionTraceEvent, AutonomyEngine v0, deterministic classifiers, MissionBudgetController, MissionKillSwitch, MissionTraceTimeline, and SafeMissionExecutors;
- updated Power Mode, runtime roadmap, and super-agent blueprint language so Power Mode is one authority level inside mission-scoped execution, not a global Full Access toggle.

Acceptance:

- Mission Authority is now the center of the G12 plan.
- Safe local GTM missions should execute end-to-end without micro-approval.
- Risky real-world powers remain disabled.
- Escalation happens at mission boundaries, not every action.
- Power Mode remains future and scoped.

- defined the new `sentinel/mission/` package and every module to build before agent implementation;
- specified mission data contracts, mission enums, autonomy routing, deterministic classifiers, budget controller, kill switch, escalation gateway, safe mission executors, trace timeline, memory protocol, skill protocol, security protocol, evidence protocol, GTM mission protocol, UI surfaces, API routes, storage model, tests, and build order;
- locked the immediate implementation sequence as G12B Mission Authority Kernel v0.

Acceptance:

- no runtime power is enabled;
- no new agent code is implemented in this sprint;
- the next coding sprint has a precise module, file, test, and acceptance map;
- Mission Authority remains the center of the architecture.
