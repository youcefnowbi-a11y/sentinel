# Sentinel Control Full Progress Report

Date: April 24, 2026  
Project: Sentinel Control  
Mode: Local-first development, no production deployment yet

## Executive Summary

Sentinel Control has been built from a clean local workspace into a working security-first agent product foundation.

The product direction is now clear:

- First commercial wedge: Sentinel GTM Operator
- Platform moat: AgentOps Firewall
- Core promise: turn CueIdea market validation into evidence-backed GTM packs and controlled execution

The system can now:

- import real CueIdea validation reports in read-only mode;
- normalize CueIdea data into Sentinel evidence;
- separate direct proof, adjacent proof, WTP/pricing signals, competitor gaps, trends, and community signals;
- create local Sentinel runs;
- generate GTM Pack files locally;
- score GTM Pack quality with business-readiness gates;
- trace every important event;
- sync imported Sentinel runs to Supabase when enabled;
- keep risky execution disabled until later controlled sprints.

No hosting or production deployment has been performed.

## Product Foundation Completed

## Backend Core Completed

Location: `services/sentinel-core`

### Shared Core

Implemented:

- models;
- enums;
- Supabase repository interfaces;
- in-memory test repository;
- validation constraints.

Core models include:

- `EvidenceItem`
- `AgentAction`
- `DecisionPlan`
- `TraceRecord`
- `DryRunPreview`
- `FirewallReview`
- `GeneratedAsset`

Core enums include:

- risk levels;
- verdicts;
- evidence types;
- approval statuses;
- trace event types.

### Trace Ledger

Implemented:

- run creation;
- trace recording;
- evidence recording;
- decision plan recording;
- action proposal recording;
- generated asset recording.

Trace is now treated as a core product requirement, not an optional log.

## AgentOps Firewall Completed

Location: `services/sentinel-core/sentinel/firewall`

Implemented:

- policy registry;
- risk scorer;
- approval gate;
- dry-run preview builder;
- allow/block assertion.

Current policies:

- `create_folder`: low risk, auto allowed inside `data/generated_projects`
- `create_file`: low risk, auto allowed inside `data/generated_projects`
- `prepare_email_draft`: medium risk, approval required
- `send_email`: high risk, disabled in v1
- `browser_submit_form`: high risk, disabled in v1
- `run_shell_command`: critical risk, disabled in v1
- `modify_code`: critical risk, disabled in v1

Important result:

No safe executor can run without Firewall review.

## CueIdea Bridge Completed

Location: `services/sentinel-core/sentinel/cueidea_bridge` and `apps/web/lib/cueidea-import.ts`

Implemented:

- CueIdea transport interface;
- validation response normalization;
- competitor normalization;
- WTP signal normalization;
- trend normalization;
- evidence mapping;
- read-only web import by validation id;
- pasted JSON import for sandbox tests.

Evidence is normalized into:

- direct proof;
- adjacent proof;
- WTP;
- pricing;
- competitor complaint/gap;
- trend;
- community signal;
- supporting evidence.

## Research, Debate, And GTM Foundation Completed

Implemented:

- Research Agent skeleton;
- source ranking;
- competitor research structure;
- deterministic multi-agent debate engine;
- skeptical challenge requirement;
- build/pivot/niche down/kill/research more verdict logic;
- GTM Pack generator.

GTM Pack sections include:

- `00_VERDICT.md`
- `01_EVIDENCE.md`
- `02_ICP.md`
- `03_COMPETITOR_GAPS.md`
- `04_LANDING_PAGE_COPY.md`
- `05_OUTREACH_MESSAGES.md`
- `06_INTERVIEW_SCRIPT.md`
- `07_7_DAY_ROADMAP.md`
- `08_WATCHLIST.md`
- `09_DECISION_RULES.md`
- `10_PROSPECT_SOURCES.md`
- `trace.json`

## Sprint 8 GTM Pack Quality Completed

Location: `services/sentinel-core/sentinel/execution/gtm_quality.py`

Added a business-quality evaluator for generated GTM Packs.

It scores:

- ICP specificity;
- WTP evidence strength;
- competitor gap clarity;
- positioning sharpness;
- outreach usefulness;
- landing copy usefulness;
- roadmap realism;
- evidence coverage.

Quality statuses:

- `draft`
- `needs_revision`
- `ready`

Readiness rules:

- every major section must have `evidence_refs` or an explicit `evidence_gap`;
- ICP cannot be generic;
- WTP must be supported or clearly marked weak;
- competitor gaps must be actionable;
- outreach must avoid spam patterns;
- the 7-day roadmap must include measurable actions.

The run detail dashboard now shows:

- GTM Pack Quality Score;
- quality status;
- section-level scores;
- blockers that prevent a pack from being marked ready.

## Safe Execution Completed

Implemented safe local executors:

- create generated project folder;
- create markdown files;
- prepare email drafts only.

Rules enforced:

- file writes stay inside `data/generated_projects`;
- email remains draft-only;
- no browser automation;
- no shell execution;
- no production code modification;
- no payment execution.

## Web Dashboard Completed

Location: `apps/web`

Built a local Next.js dashboard with these routes:

- `/dashboard`
- `/dashboard/agents`
- `/dashboard/agents/[runId]`
- `/dashboard/cueidea`
- `/dashboard/firewall`
- `/dashboard/customers`
- `/dashboard/evidence`
- `/dashboard/traces`
- `/dashboard/evals`
- `/dashboard/execution`
- `/dashboard/billing`
- `/dashboard/generated-projects/[id]`

Main UI capabilities:

- create local Sentinel runs;
- inspect evidence;
- review Firewall actions;
- approve or reject actions;
- record feedback;
- view trace ledger;
- view eval coverage;
- view execution board;
- view GTM Pack quality status and blockers;
- update watchlist items;
- prepare paid-run quotes with payment disabled;
- import CueIdea validations;
- generate local GTM Pack files.

## Learning Layer Completed

Location: `services/sentinel-core/sentinel/learning`

Implemented:

- feedback records;
- feedback summaries;
- memory entries;
- in-memory memory store;
- prompt version registry;
- self-improvement proposal generation.

Safe pattern:

- the agent may propose improvements;
- it does not modify production code automatically;
- every proposal includes evidence, risk, patch suggestion, and tests needed.

## Evaluation System Completed

Location: `packages/evals`

Eval datasets created for:

- safe actions;
- dangerous actions;
- weak ideas;
- strong ideas;
- spammy outreach;
- compliant outreach;
- prompt injection cases;
- fake evidence cases;
- business-quality cases.

Business-quality datasets added:

- `vague_icp.jsonl`
- `weak_positioning.jsonl`
- `generic_landing_copy.jsonl`
- `weak_outreach.jsonl`
- `missing_wtp.jsonl`
- `bad_competitor_gap.jsonl`
- `unrealistic_roadmap.jsonl`
- `strong_gtm_pack_examples.jsonl`

Eval coverage verifies:

- dangerous actions are blocked;
- weak evidence cannot force a build decision;
- spammy outreach is detected;
- prompt injection is detected;
- fake evidence is downgraded;
- trace logs are produced;
- weak GTM Packs are flagged before they are treated as ready.

## Sprint 6 Completed

Added:

- Execution Board;
- watchlist updates;
- paid-run quote preparation;
- learning layer v0;
- `/dashboard/execution`;
- `/dashboard/billing`.

Watchlist supports:

- competitor gap watch;
- WTP interview watch;
- execution risk watch.

Paid-run preparation supports:

- local quote generation;
- quote line items;
- `payment_disabled` status;
- trace event recording.

## Sprint 7A Completed

Added:

- read-only CueIdea import;
- import by `idea_validations.id`;
- pasted report JSON import;
- local CueIdea import dashboard;
- normalized CueIdea evidence;
- local GTM Pack generation from imported runs.

Trace events added:

- `cueidea_imported`
- `evidence_recorded`
- `decision_created`
- `action_proposed`
- `action_executed`
- `asset_generated`

## Sprint 7B Completed

Added:

- real CueIdea credentials wired into ignored local `.env.local`;
- `apps/web/.env.example`;
- real CueIdea validation import test;
- real CueIdea report section extraction;
- prospect/source extraction;
- richer CueIdea UI;
- persistent Supabase sync for imported Sentinel runs;
- auth/user separation before hosting;
- deployment plan.

## Sprint 8 Completed

Added:

- business-quality eval datasets;
- GTM Pack quality evaluator;
- GTM Pack quality status: `draft`, `needs_revision`, `ready`;
- business eval runner support;
- dashboard quality gate on run detail;
- eval dashboard coverage for business-quality datasets.

Important result:

- Sentinel now checks whether a GTM Pack is commercially useful enough before presenting it as ready.
- Missing WTP, vague ICP, generic positioning, weak outreach, weak competitor gaps, and unrealistic roadmaps are explicitly detected.
- No new execution capability was enabled.

## Agent Lab Setup Completed

Created sibling workspace:

- `../agent-lab`

Purpose:

- research OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, OpenJarvis, and JARVIS without merging vendor code into Sentinel;
- map useful runtime patterns;
- map failure modes;
- define safe benchmark tasks;
- decide what Sentinel should take, rewrite, avoid, or postpone.

Created:

- `agent-lab/README.md`
- `agent-lab/AGENT_LAB_PLAN.md`
- `agent-lab/vendors/README.md`
- vendor slots for OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, OpenJarvis, and JARVIS;
- `agent-lab/audits/CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md`
- `agent-lab/audits/FAILURE_MODES.md`
- `agent-lab/audits/REUSE_STRATEGY.md`
- vendor-specific audit maps for OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, OpenJarvis, and JARVIS;
- `agent-lab/audits/vendor_clone_checks.md`
- `agent-lab/benchmarks/BENCHMARK_PLAN.md`
- benchmark task folders for browser, file, email, memory, security, GTM, and sandbox workspace;
- adapter note folders for OpenClaw-style channels, Hermes-style skills, JARVIS-style sidecar, and OpenJarvis-style local model routing;
- `agent-lab/sentinel_integration_notes/SENTINEL_RUNTIME_BLUEPRINT.md`.

Important boundary:

- no vendor code was copied into Sentinel;
- no vendor runtime was executed;
- no risky capability was enabled;
- Agent Lab remains research-only until a sandbox plan is approved for each vendor.

## Agent Lab Sprint B1 Completed

OpenClaw static audit was completed as the first measured Agent Lab audit.

Completed:

- cloned OpenClaw source into `../agent-lab/vendors/openclaw/source`;
- recorded source clone decision in `agent-lab/audits/vendor_clone_checks.md`;
- created `agent-lab/audits/openclaw_static_audit.md`;
- updated `agent-lab/audits/openclaw_capability_map.md`;
- updated `agent-lab/audits/CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md`;
- updated `agent-lab/audits/FAILURE_MODES.md`;
- created `agent-lab/sentinel_integration_notes/openclaw_to_sentinel.md`.

Observed OpenClaw facts:

- shallow clone commit: `a2288c2b0`;
- source size: `4,881` files / `41,400,764` bytes;
- dependency manager: `pnpm@10.23.0`;
- runtime: TypeScript/JavaScript monorepo, Node `>=22.12.0`;
- plugin manifests observed: `30`;
- bundled skills observed: `52`.

Important boundary:

- OpenClaw was not installed;
- OpenClaw was not run;
- no skills/extensions were executed;
- no accounts, browser profiles, secrets, or messaging services were connected;
- no code was copied from OpenClaw into Sentinel production.

Sprint 7B real-data fix:

- The real CueIdea `idea_validations` table does not include `updated_at`.
- The read-only importer was corrected to select only valid columns.

## Real CueIdea Import Test

Tested with a completed CueIdea validation:

- validation id: `22c65e5d-739f-4249-b8ee-be1c81e23019`
- idea: `An SEO tool that automatically tracks keyword rankings by country and provides clear, actionable reasons for low page indexing.`
- imported evidence rows: `10`
- extracted prospect/source rows: `4`
- extracted report section keys: `24`
- generated local files: `12`
- generated project status: `Files written locally`
- Sentinel Supabase sync: confirmed

Also tested a newer failed CueIdea validation to prove the pipeline can still import available report data:

- validation id: `2f091afb-7d64-4119-a497-4fffdf73536d`
- imported evidence rows: `4`
- extracted prospect/source rows: `4`
- generated local files: `12`
- Sentinel Supabase sync: confirmed

## Supabase Work Completed

Created migration:

- `supabase/migrations/001_sentinel_core.sql`

Tables covered:

- `agent_runs`
- `evidence_items`
- `decision_plans`
- `agent_actions`
- `generated_assets`
- `trace_records`
- `firewall_policies`

Web app can now sync Sentinel runs to Supabase when:

- `SENTINEL_ENABLE_SUPABASE_SYNC=true`

Local credentials are stored in:

- `apps/web/.env.local`

Template is stored in:

- `apps/web/.env.example`

## Auth/User Separation Completed

Implemented API-level user boundary:

- local development uses `local_user`;
- hosted mode can require auth with `SENTINEL_REQUIRE_AUTH=true`;
- API routes resolve a user before reading or mutating run state;
- run reads and updates are scoped by `user_id`;
- Supabase bearer tokens can be verified server-side.

Current local mode:

- `SENTINEL_REQUIRE_AUTH=false`

Hosted-ready mode:

- `SENTINEL_REQUIRE_AUTH=true`

## Verification Status

Latest checks passed:

- Python tests: `34 passed`
- TypeScript: `npx tsc --noEmit` passed
- Next production build: `npm run build --silent` passed
- Local CueIdea route smoke test passed
- Real CueIdea import test passed
- Local GTM Pack generation passed
- Sentinel Supabase sync passed

## Current Product State

Sentinel Control is now a working local product prototype with real CueIdea integration.

It can:

1. Read a real CueIdea validation report.
2. Normalize market evidence.
3. Create a Sentinel run.
4. Build an evidence-backed GTM Pack.
5. Score the GTM Pack against business-quality readiness gates.
6. Extract prospect/source opportunities.
7. Write local project files.
8. Trace every important action.
9. Sync run data to Sentinel Supabase tables.
10. Keep risky actions blocked.

## Still Not Active

These features are intentionally not active:

- payment integration;
- email sending;
- browser automation;
- autonomous code modification;
- unrestricted filesystem access;
- shell execution;
- skill marketplace;
- advanced standalone AgentOps Firewall product features.

## Remaining Work Before Hosting

Before deployment:

- review hosted environment variables;
- set `SENTINEL_REQUIRE_AUTH=true`;
- confirm Supabase Auth flow;
- test a staging deploy;
- verify user isolation in staging;
- verify generated files stay in the expected environment path;
- run production build in staging;
- import one real CueIdea validation in staging;
- confirm no later-only features are active.

## Recommended Next Phase

Next recommended phase: Sprint 9 Research Agent Upgrade, then private staging.

Suggested tasks:

1. Improve competitor and alternative discovery.
2. Add stronger pricing and WTP source extraction.
3. Add ICP/community source categories.
4. Add objections and buying-trigger extraction.
5. Add evidence-gap reporting.
6. Test at least 10 ideas locally before public staging.
7. Prepare private staging only after the pack quality is consistently strong.
8. Keep high-impact automation disabled.

## Final Position

Sentinel Control has moved from idea and documentation into a functional local system.

The important foundation is now in place:

- CueIdea provides market intelligence.
- Sentinel normalizes it into evidence.
- Debate and GTM logic turn it into a decision package.
- The quality layer tests whether the package is specific, evidenced, and actionable.
- Firewall controls execution.
- Trace ledger records the run.
- Local files create a usable handoff pack.
- Auth and deployment planning are ready for staging.

The project is ready for a Research Agent upgrade and private staging preparation, while high-impact automation remains deliberately disabled.
