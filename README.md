# SENTINAL

SENTINAL is the GitHub workspace for the evolution from CueIdea/RedditPulse into Sentinel Control.

The repository name is `SENTINAL`, but the product name used in the code and docs is **Sentinel Control**.

This repo contains **two apps plus one research lab**:

1. `RedditPulse/` - the existing CueIdea market-validation app and evidence engine.
2. `sentinel-control/` - the new Sentinel Control product: evidence-backed GTM packs, decision agents, approvals, trace logs, and AgentOps Firewall.
3. `agent-lab/` - a research-only lab for studying agent runtimes such as OpenClaw without mixing vendor runtime code into production.

If you are continuing development, start here. This README explains what the project is, why it exists, how the folders connect, what is production, what is research, how to run things, and what to build next.

## Current Snapshot - 2026-05-08

This repository is the full Sentinel working tree snapshot. It includes the
legacy CueIdea/RedditPulse evidence product, the Sentinel Control runtime, and
Agent Lab, which is the forensic lab used to study external agent systems before
rewriting useful powers into Sentinel-native contracts.

Current locked project compass:

```text
current_phase = ARCHITECTURE_A_TO_Z_LOCKED
previous_phase = P5L_FULL_LOCKED
next_phase = P6A_EXTERNAL_ORGAN_FOUNDRY
```

The active architecture lock lives here:

```text
sentinel-control/docs/architecture/SENTINEL_A_TO_Z_LOCK/
```

Start with:

```text
sentinel-control/docs/architecture/SENTINEL_A_TO_Z_LOCK/00_README_PROJECT_COMPASS.md
sentinel-control/docs/CURRENT_STATE_LOCK.md
```

Brain L4 is already locked through P5L. That means Sentinel now has internal
advisory modules for mission entropy, agent-count routing, society planning,
workspace state, Bayesian belief updates, adaptive debate planning, epistemic
action scoring, resourcefulness, skill procedure matching, BrainBench, and an
integrated pre-mortem review. These modules are internal cognition only; they
do not grant external powers.

The next build target is P6A External Organ Foundry. P6A begins the executable
contract layer for future external organs, but it still does not add payment
runtime, trading runtime, account creation, credential access, browser power
expansion, external API mutation, or production mutation.

Useful current verification commands:

```powershell
cd sentinel-control/services/sentinel-core
python -m pytest tests/test_p6_external_organ_foundry.py -v --tb=short
python -m pytest tests/test_agent_event_bus.py tests/test_p6_external_organ_foundry.py -v --tb=short
```

Latest local P6A targeted result before this publish snapshot:

```text
P6A External Organ Foundry targeted tests = 12 passed
P6A + event bus neighbor tests = 19 passed
```

Important governance rule:

```text
Agent Lab harvests powers.
Sentinel rewrites them behind authority, risk, receipts, replay, kill switch,
promotion gates, and FinalGate.
Vendor runtime code is not imported as production runtime.
```

## Executive Summary

CueIdea/RedditPulse already validates ideas by collecting market signals, competitors, pain points, willingness-to-pay indicators, and opportunity gaps.

Sentinel Control is the new product layer on top of that evidence. It takes an idea or an imported CueIdea report, builds an evidence ledger, researches the market, debates the decision, generates a GTM pack, proposes safe actions, sends those actions through the AgentOps Firewall, and records a trace log.

Agent Lab is the R&D area. It studies powerful agent systems and turns their risky runtime patterns into safe Sentinel requirements: scan, score, preview, approve, trace, then execute only what is allowed.

The north star is simple:

```text
Idea
  -> evidence
  -> decision
  -> GTM pack
  -> risk review
  -> user approval
  -> safe execution
  -> trace log
```

## Why This Exists

Most agent products try to impress users by doing more actions automatically.

Sentinel Control is different. It is built around proof and control:

- It should not be a generic chatbot.
- It should not blindly execute tasks.
- It should not auto-send emails in v1.
- It should not auto-modify production code.
- It should not run shell commands as a product feature in v1.
- It should turn market evidence into a business decision and a useful GTM operating package.
- It should make every risky action pass through policy, dry-run preview, approval, and trace logging.

The first commercial wedge is **Sentinel GTM Operator**.

The long-term platform moat is **AgentOps Firewall**.

## The Two Apps, Without Confusion

This repo intentionally has two app areas.

### App 1: RedditPulse / CueIdea

`RedditPulse/` is the existing market intelligence product.

It answers questions like:

- Is this startup idea showing real demand?
- What pain points are repeated in communities?
- What competitors or alternatives already exist?
- Are there willingness-to-pay signals?
- Which segments or niches look promising?

Think of RedditPulse/CueIdea as the **evidence engine**.

### App 2: Sentinel Control

`sentinel-control/` is the new agent product.

It answers questions like:

- Given this evidence, should we build, pivot, niche down, kill, or research more?
- What is the best ICP?
- What should the positioning be?
- What landing copy, outreach drafts, interview script, and 7-day validation plan should we use?
- Which actions are safe?
- Which actions need approval?
- What trace proves how the agent made the decision?

Think of Sentinel Control as the **decision and controlled-execution layer**.

### Research Lab: Agent Lab

`agent-lab/` is not a third production app.

It is a research workspace for studying external agent runtimes. The goal is to learn from their architecture without importing their risks.

Think of Agent Lab as the **runtime safety research lab**.

## How The Pieces Connect

The intended product flow is:

```text
RedditPulse / CueIdea
  market validation, competitor signals, pain, WTP, trends

        feeds evidence into

Sentinel Control
  EvidenceItem records, research agent, debate engine, GTM pack generator

        controlled by

AgentOps Firewall
  policy, risk score, dry-run preview, approval gate, trace ledger

        informed by

Agent Lab
  scanner research, capability maps, failure modes, future runtime blueprint
```

Important rule:

`agent-lab` does not directly feed vendor code into `sentinel-control`. It produces audits, scanners, benchmark plans, and integration requirements only.

## What Is Production And What Is Research

`RedditPulse/` is the existing product codebase and evidence source.

`sentinel-control/` is the new product being built. This is where product features should go.

`agent-lab/` is research-only. It can contain audits, scanners, fake benchmarks, and design notes. It must not become a shortcut for adding risky runtime features into Sentinel.

## How To Continue Development

Read these first:

1. `README.md` - this root handoff.
2. `sentinel-control/README.md` - Sentinel Control app instructions.
3. `sentinel-control/WORKSPACE_MAP.md` - Sentinel folder map and build zones.
4. `sentinel-control/docs/FULL_PROGRESS_REPORT.md` - detailed progress report.
5. `agent-lab/AGENT_LAB_PLAN.md` - Agent Lab current sprint status.
6. `RedditPulse/README.md` and `RedditPulse/WORKSPACE_MAP.md` - CueIdea/RedditPulse context.

Then choose your work area:

- Improving idea validation or existing CueIdea behavior: work in `RedditPulse/`.
- Improving GTM packs, decisions, firewall, traces, dashboard, or Sentinel product behavior: work in `sentinel-control/`.
- Auditing external agent runtimes, scanners, fake benchmarks, or future runtime safety research: work in `agent-lab/`.

```

Note: the source path above expects a local vendor clone that is intentionally ignored by git.

## Environment Files

Do not commit real credentials.

Common local env locations:

```text
RedditPulse/.env
RedditPulse/app/.env.local
sentinel-control/apps/web/.env.local
```

Use examples/templates where available:

```text
sentinel-control/apps/web/.env.example
```

Supabase credentials are expected to come from environment variables, not source code.

## Safety And Product Rules

Sentinel v1 must keep these disabled or approval-gated:

- autonomous email sending;
- browser form submission;
- shell execution;
- production code modification;
- unrestricted filesystem access;
- payment flows;
- real channel/message sending;
- skill marketplace installation;
- desktop sidecar control.

Every future execution feature must have:

- evidence;
- risk score;
- permission policy;
- dry-run preview;
- explicit user approval when required;
- trace log;
- eval coverage;
- tests.

No feature should be added as "just an assistant capability" unless it maps to one of:

1. Sentinel GTM Operator.
2. AgentOps Firewall.
3. Controlled research inside Agent Lab.

## Current Known Gaps

The strongest next product risk is not architecture. It is output quality.

The next developer should focus on:

- making generated GTM packs more useful and less generic;
- improving ICP specificity;
- improving WTP and pricing evidence handling;
- improving competitor gap quality;
- making outreach drafts evidence-backed and non-spammy;
- making 7-day roadmaps measurable and realistic;
- testing packs with real founder/agency ideas;
- keeping all risky execution disabled until security gates are complete.

Technical gaps still to treat carefully:

- hosted staging needs final auth/user isolation checks;
- Supabase sync must keep service role keys server-side only;
- Research Agent quality must improve beyond simple wrappers;
- Agent Lab B3 fake benchmarks should come before any runtime bridge;
- payments, email sending, browser automation, desktop automation, and skill marketplace are later-only features.

## Recommended Next Work

### Product Track

1. Run 10 real idea inputs through Sentinel.
2. Score GTM Pack quality with the business-quality evaluator.
3. Improve weak sections before adding new execution features.
4. Add private staging only after auth and user isolation are verified.
5. Test willingness to pay manually before adding payment integration.

### Engineering Track

1. Keep Python and Next tests passing.
2. Keep Supabase migrations explicit and reviewed.
3. Add evals for every new agent behavior.
4. Preserve trace logging for every run, decision, action proposal, and generated asset.
5. Keep file writes constrained to allowed generated-project paths.

### Agent Lab Track

1. Continue with fake benchmarks only.
2. Do not install or run vendor runtimes on the host.
3. Build scanner-backed requirements before any adapter.
4. Promote nothing into Sentinel without Firewall policy implications.

## Definition Of Done For New Work

A change is not complete unless the relevant items are true:

- The feature maps to GTM Operator, AgentOps Firewall, or Agent Lab research.
- Docs explain the behavior if it changes product direction or safety behavior.
- Tests or evals cover the new behavior.
- No secrets are committed.
- Risky actions remain blocked or approval-gated.
- Generated actions have dry-run previews.
- Important outputs reference evidence or explicit evidence gaps.
- Trace records exist for decisions/actions/assets.
- README or workspace docs are updated if the developer path changes.

## Git Hygiene

Do not commit:

- `.env`, `.env.local`, API keys, tokens, service role keys, or secrets;
- generated GTM packs from `sentinel-control/data/generated_projects`;
- Python caches, Next build outputs, `node_modules`, or virtual environments;
- third-party vendor runtime clones under `agent-lab/vendors/*/source`;
- RedditPulse local state such as `.gitnexus`, `.claude`, and working proxy files.

Before pushing, check:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --check
```

For large future changes, include a short commit message that names the affected area:

```text
sentinel-control: improve GTM quality evaluator
agent-lab: add fake channel benchmark
RedditPulse: update validation parser
```

## North Star

RedditPulse proves market demand and gathers evidence.

Sentinel Control turns that evidence into business decisions, GTM packs, and controlled agent actions.

Agent Lab helps Sentinel learn from powerful agent runtimes without importing their risks.

The final product direction is:

```text
proof before recommendation
decision before execution
permission before impact
trace before trust
```
